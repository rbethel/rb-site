## Deploy your own

[![Deploy to Begin](https://static.begin.com/deploy-to-begin.svg)](https://begin.com/apps/create?template=https://github.com/begin-examples/node-eleventy-blog)

Deploy your own clone of this app to Begin!

## Getting started

- Install the dependencies: `npm install`
- Run your new shiny blog: `npm start`

## Set Environment Variables
- Adding an environment variable in the Begin console, `ARC_STATIC_SPA=false`, will allow a proxy at API Gateway to serve static assets directly from the S3 bucket like a basic web server.
- Check out the docs for [setting environment variables on Begin](https://docs.begin.com/en/getting-started/environments#overview).
